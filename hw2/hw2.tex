\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be a space such that all paths having the same endpoints are fixed-endpoint
  homotopic. Then given a loop $\alpha$ based as some point $x_0$ this loop is homotopic
  to the constant map at $x_0$ which implies that $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is trivial for all
  $X$. Therefore $X$ is simply connected.

  Now suppose that $X$ is a simply connected space. Let $\alpha,\beta$ be loops from $x_0$ to
  $x_1$. For a fixed $t'\in [0,1]$ using path connectedness we can construct a loop
  $l_{t'}$ such that $l_{t'}(0)=l_{t'}(1)=\alpha(t')$, $l_{t'}(\frac{1}{2})=\beta(t)$ and
  that the function $p(t)=l_{t}(\frac{1}{2})$ is a path.
  If we had two loops that separated t


  Since $X$ is simply connected there is a homotopy $L_{t'}$ from $l_{t'}$ to the
  constant map at $\alpha(t')$. Then we can construct a homotopy $H$ from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ as
  \[ H(t,s)= L_t(\frac{1}{2},s) \]
  which will be continuous because of the continuity of the $L_{t'}$s and that
  we choose $l_{t'}$ such that as we vary over $t$ there is a path.

  Therefore a space $X$ is simply connected if and only if all paths with the same
  endpoints are fixed endpoint homotopic.

\begin{proof}
  Let $f:(X,x_0)\rightarrow (Y,y_0)$ and $g:(Y,y_0)\rightarrow (Z,z_0)$. For a continuous map
  $h$ we have $h_*$ defined as $h_*([\gamma])=[h\circ \gamma]$. Then if we consider
  $(g\circ f)_*$:
  \[ (g\circ f)_*([\gamma]) = [(g\circ f)\circ \gamma] = [g\circ (f\circ \gamma)] = g_*([f\circ \gamma])=g_*\circ f_*([\gamma])\]

  Therefore $(g\circ f)_*=g_*\circ f_*$.

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $B$ be simply connected, $E$ path connected, and $p:E\rightarrow B$ a covering map.
  By the Theorem from class since $E$ is path connected there exists a
  surjective map $\phi:\pi_1(B,b_0)\rightarrow p^{-1}(b_0)$. However since $B$ is simply connected
  the fundamental group is trivial which implies that $p^{-1}(b_0)$ has only one
  element. Since $B$ is simply connected it is also connected so it follows that
  $p^{-1}(b)$ contains only a single element for all $b\in B$. As there is only one
  copy of $B$ in $E$ this implies that $p|_E=p$ and as such $p$ is a homeomorphism.

  Therefore if $B$ is simply connected, then any covering map for which $E$ is
  path connected is a homeomorphism.

\begin{proof}
  Let $h:(X,x_0)\rightarrow (Y,y_0)$ be an inessential map and let $[\gamma]\in \pi(X,x_0)$.
  Since $h$ is inessential it follows that there is a homotopy $H$ that
  sends $h$ to the constant map at $y_0$. If we take $h_*([\gamma])=[h\circ\gamma]$
  then we can create a homotopy $H'(t,s)=H(\gamma(t),s)$ that will take $\gamma$
  to the constant map which implies that d $h_*([\gamma])=[y_0]$. Since
  this happens for an arbitrary loop in $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ it follows that
  the map $h_*$ is trivial.

  Therefore if $h:(X,x_0)\rightarrow (Y,y_0)$ is inessential then the induced homomorphism
  $h_*$ is trivial.
